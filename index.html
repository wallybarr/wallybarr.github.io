				<p><bold>We solve business problems. We do it in a way so the problem is eliminated. It provides the foundation of continual growth.    <a href="/how">See how we do it!</a></bold></p>
			        <p>One step forward, two steps back. How many times have you uttered these words? As a business owner or a career minded employee we have all felt this way at one time or another. It is when this feeling becomes much to frequent that you realize that you have a problem. Understanding and solving this problem is a key factor in the success of you or your company. The cause of this problem is acceptance. It is accepted within the business community that this is a normal problem that every business has to deal with and the answer must be searched for not knowing if it actually exists. It is accepted that business owners work longer hours. It is accepted that sales people make one hundred calls to fill the pipeline. It is accepted that sales and marketing will never get along. We agree this problem does exist in most businesses. Where we disagree is that the solution does not exist and the path to the answer is the one chosen by the majority of business owners and people. The answer does exist. We have it. Working longer hours, making more calls and accepting that marketing and sales will always be in a battle is not the answer. If working more hours is your answer then your business growth is limited to the amount of waking hours you can deliver. If making more calls is your answer, the same still applies and the obvious answer would be to hire more dialers. It still does not address the problem that sales people only spend 22% of their time in front of prospects. What do they do with the balance of their time? This theory does nothing to solve your marketing problem. It does nothing to remedy the fact that 92% of marketing materials go unused or help bridge the divide between marketing and sales.</p><br>
<p>Our company does all that. We solve all these problems in a simple and practical way. We are as involved only as much as you want us to be. Our pricing is what you can afford. More specifically, it is designed to allow you to realize that you canâ€™t afford not to let us help you.</p><br>
<p>You now have two simple choices. You can do nothing and tackle these problems on your own and accept this is the way business is done or you can contact us and allow us to show you what our company does to help people and businesses to work more effectively, produce more results and actually enjoy what they do.
					It is a simple choice. We have a simple solution. Business should be simple.</p>
