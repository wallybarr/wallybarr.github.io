        		<h1>UNDRNU - The Story</h1>
				<p>The company was born out of frustration. Frustrated with many things in business and the business environment.  We believe that there is a better way. There is a simple way to become successful and enjoy your work and life outside of work more. There is a great deal of noise that people deal with every day. It becomes very easy to become distracted or detoured from what really matters. It makes life at work and home become very hectic and unclear. We feel this is the main cause of the world being as crazy as it is today. Our goal is to fix this problem.</p> <br>
<p>Working in a family owned print business for over 25 years has provided me the opportunity to experience many things in the business world. I have experienced the good, the bad, and the ugly when it relates to business life. I have personally experienced disruption of an industry. I have witnessed how one bad hire can topple a successful company in one year. I have worked those 80 hour weeks. I have worked with some great companies and people. I have also worked with the total opposite. My experience has provided the opportunity to collaborate with large and very elaborate organizations as well as multi - million dollar companies operating out of a mobile home. I know what works and what doesn’t.</p> <br> 
<p>You can benefit from my experiences. The problems you are having related to your business, I have most likely, witnessed or experienced and solved. At the very least, I have seen the end result of not solving these problems. I have worked with some great successes and some crazy failures. Most organizations fall somewhere in the middle. We help you become more capable to become a success or move away from the middle towards the elite. It is truly a very simple concept.
